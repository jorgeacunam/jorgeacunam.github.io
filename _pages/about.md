Jorge Acuña is an Assistant Professor of Operations Research and the director/founder of the Health Systems Engineering Laboratory (HSE Lab) at Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez. He also holds a Courtesy Assitant Professor position in Industrial and Management Systems Engineering at the University of South Florida (USF). His research is built upon the intersection of operations research and healthcare systems to improve patient outcomes and access. Most recent research activities have focused on emergency department overcrowding, surgical waiting lists, healthcare costs, food waste, length of stay, kidney transplants, and emergency medical services. He received a Ph.D. (2021) and an MSc. (2018) in Industrial Engineering from USF and a B.S. in Industrial Engineering with specialization in Mechanics from Universidad de La Frontera in 2015. Over the past few years, he has lectured medical students on operations research and mentored engineering doctoral and master students.

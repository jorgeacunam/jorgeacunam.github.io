  Jorge Acuña is an Assistant Professor of Operations Research and the director/founder of the Health Systems Engineering Laboratory (HSE Lab) at Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez. He also holds a Courtesy Assistant Professor position in Industrial and Management Systems Engineering at the University of South Florida (USF). His research is built upon the intersection of operations research and healthcare systems to improve patient outcomes and access.

Professor Acuña has a track record of developing innovative mathematical models anchored in optimization, game theory, and stochastic programming to address critical health issues. Current research activities focus on emergency department overcrowding, waiting lists, health investment, food waste, length of stay, surgery schedule, kidney transplants, and emergency medical services.

He received his Ph.D. (2021) and MSc. (2018) in Industrial Engineering from USF and a B.S. in Civil Industrial Engineering from Universidad de La Frontera in 2015. Over the past few years, he has lectured medical students on operations research and mentored engineering doctoral and master students.
